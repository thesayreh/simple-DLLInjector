# simple-DLLInjector

A lightweight and educational DLL injector written in C++ (x64), designed for Windows-based systems. This project demonstrates a basic but fully functional approach to DLL injection using `OpenProcess`, `VirtualAllocEx`, `WriteProcessMemory`, and `CreateRemoteThread`.

üõ†Ô∏è **What it does**:
- Prompts the user for a target process PID
- Allocates memory in the remote process
- Writes a DLL path to the allocated memory
- Loads the DLL using `LoadLibraryA` via a remote thread

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer

This project is strictly for educational purposes. Use responsibly. I do not condone cheating in games or malicious use of code.

## üîß How to use

1. Compile in `Release x64`.
2. Provide a valid DLL path in the source code.
3. Run the injector and input the target PID.
